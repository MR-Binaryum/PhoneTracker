# PhoneTracker

PhoneTracker its a software writted on Python that i maked...

This software help's you to get sensitive information of phonenumbers that you want to track.
The info can change depending if a phonenumber uses line mobile, fixed or other lines...

Apart of this the tool comes with a personal animation writted on BASH scripting language that executes every time when you start the program and you are tracking a phonenumber.

This program for now its a beta version because i want to put other tracking functionalities like:
